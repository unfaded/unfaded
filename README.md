## Experience
I've been programming for 5 years, with the last 3 years developing nearly every day. I started with C++, expanded to Python and TypeScript, then transitioned to Rust for new projects about 2 years ago.

## Languages
**Rust** - My primary language and preference for most projects. I use it for high-performance backends, native desktop applications, and web interfaces. I recently began publishing my projects on GitHub and contributing to open source
**C++** - Legacy codebases and systems programming  
**TypeScript** - Web development when projects require it  
**Python** - Data analysis and scripting  

## Expertise
- High-performance backend systems
- Native cross-platform desktop applications
- User interfaces
- System-level programming (Linux systems, Windows internals)
- Data analysis pipelines
- Docker deployment workflows

**Environment**: Arch Linux
